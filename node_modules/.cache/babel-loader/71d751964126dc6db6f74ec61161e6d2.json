During his co-operative education work terms, Iman’s primary focus has been on breast cancer research, with a deeper focus on the rare occurrence of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. In his most recent co-op at Mount Sinai Hospital, he collaborated with a multidisciplinary care team including physicians and oncology and obstetrical nurses to develop a comprehensive course on the topic of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. In October, Iman and his research team presented their research and course at the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology conference and won first place for the Educational category. Today, Iman and his team continue to expand on their breast cancer in pregnancy course, with the objective to add more cancer sites. The application of Iman’s and his team’s research aims to educate oncology and obstetrical health care professionals on the importance of using evidence-based medicine to shape their clinical practice.\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            <div\n              class=\"column\"\n              style={{\n                paddingLeft: \"0px\",\n                paddingTop: \"35px\",\n                marginRight: \"300px\",\n              }}>\n              <ExecCard\n                img={karandeep_gill}\n                name=\"Karandeep Gill\"\n                position=\"How to Achieve Resilience Through Self-Compassion\"\n                description=\"Karandeep Gill is a speech communication and business undergrad student at the University of Waterloo.

Her research revolves around how one can overpower traumatic experiences like extreme paranoia, vivid hallucinations, and suicidal ideation through the art of self-compassion.
